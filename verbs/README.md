How to evaluate a dialect on an LLM like gpt?


i's basically getting influenced but in a way that you treat all cases.


how to make the paper/work systematic:
- understand the api
- we need to classify the evaluation: when do we say okay, when do we say not okay, when do we say perhaps.
- Use with not just not the roles user and system roles but other roles and dictionary (few shot) = gloassary?
- scrape the 14 idioms and play with them (qualitative descreptive work).
- I should make sure that rather than getting influenced by the empirical tries(bias), to come up with a list of all things a prompt should have.



Evaluation:
- synsets for words
-
