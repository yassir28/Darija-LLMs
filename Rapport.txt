### User role:
you who is chatting or who's asking chat gpt

### assistant role: 
They are the modelâ€™s responses based on the user messages.
Can serve theoritically in simulated few shot prompt engineering

### System role: 
Allows you to specify the way the model answers questions



### 3 . 50 outputs analysis: Reverting to MSA due to Diacritics, Articulation and emphasis

13: da99, daa9 : knocked, tasted

14: 9as, 9aas: measured, touch

For more context next up work with two transliteration and darija arabic for more context. try it out.
These are the examples of words that didnt match in the first 50 words from the verbs.

I will highlight the most important for an easy read.

- {9rra read teach}: in the prononciation model does not interpret articulation and emphasis doesnt recognise.

- {Da9 knocked taste}: darija doesnt use letter "dh" instead it uses a lighter one in speech and writing d and that makes an interpretation difference for the model. Tho the model doesnt notice the emphasis difference and base its translation presumably on that letter. possible reversion to arabic. 

- {9as measured touch}:  revert to msa.

- {Tala3 go_out ascend} : in darija this has a deviated meaning the msa might have deviated long ago => makes sense

- {3am live swim}  can be interpreted as "year" but also has a meaning in the dictionary of arabic with swim but it's an old meaning that's not usually used in Arabic nowadays only in Darija. Model has ouputted a random verb which at least is conform to the query of a verb output.  

- {slat asked take_off}. has outputted a verb that sounds the same. Reversion to MSA.

- {ttawa iron bargain} I don't understand the model's rationale.  

- {ms7 wipe clean}: this is both the wordnet's fault for giving it too low of similarity 0.16 and the dataset's, cos it has both meanings (that can only be understood in context).

- {tskhskh whisper exhaust} : unique to darija

- {ghdb get-angry anger} : model doesnt follow instruction as told 

- {dar HOUSE DO}: has a right interpretation but as a name. model doesnt recognize it as a verb. unique to darija

- {3ndo he-has have} : doesnt follow instructions

- {chedd tighten get}: meaning can only be infered from context in darija

- {ba come want} : meaningless interpretation

- {wlla or become}

- {3na have mean}


CASES: 
Correct guess but in a different context in darija due to emphasis 2  

Correct guess but only in Standard Arabic (revert to standard arabic) 3

Correct but model doesnt follow instructions: 4
  - adds an article or "to" or "will", etc. and doesnt answer with a word-by-word as instructed. 2
  - interprets it as a name 1
  - intereprets it as a conjunction 1

Not correct 5
  - unique in darija 3
  - exists in standard arabic but missed it 2

other 1


One other 
I wonder if emphasis issues will be resolved with context. (sentences?)




 # temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.
