Since I did A year of intensive studies in Morocco I collected and translated Moroccan cultural expressions with a great deal of help from my instructor. Proverbs, expressions and idioms in dialect are great for demonstrating knowledge of the culture. If your target audience, doesn't understand Darija this is no problem. You can take a chunk out of a word count pretty quickly explaining some of these expressions.
